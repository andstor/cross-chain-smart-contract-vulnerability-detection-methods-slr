@techreport{kitchenham2007guidelines,
  abstract             = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},

@inproceedings{ye2020clairvoyance,
  abstract   = {Reentrancy bugs in smart contracts caused a devastating financial loss in 2016, considered
                as one of the most severe vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Most of the existing
                general-purpose security tools for smart contracts have claimed to be able to detect
                reentrancy bugs. In this paper, we present Clairvoyance, a cross-function and cross-contract
                static analysis by identifying infeasible paths to detect reentrancy vulnerabilities
                in smart contracts. To reduce FPs, we have summarized five major path protective techniques
                (PPTs) to support fast yet precise path feasibility checking. We have implemented
                our approach and compared Clairvoyance with three state-of-the-art tools on 17770
                real-worlds contracts. The results show that Clairvoyance yields the best detection
                accuracy among all the tools.},

  abstract  = {Analyzing Ethereum bytecode, rather than the source code from which it was generated, is a necessity when: (1) the source code is not available (e.g., the blockchain only stores the bytecode), (2) the information to be gathered in the analysis is only visible at the level of bytecode (e.g., gas consumption is specified at the level of EVM instructions), (3) the analysis results may be affected by optimizations performed by the compiler (thus the analysis should be done ideally after compilation). This paper presents EthIR, a framework for analyzing Ethereum bytecode, which relies on (an extension of) Oyente, a tool that generates CFGs; EthIR produces from the CFGs, a rule-based representation (RBR) of the bytecode that enables the application of (existing) high-level analyses to infer properties of EVM code.},

  abstract  = {Souffl{\'e}¬†is an open source programming framework that performs static program analysis expressed in Datalog on very large code bases, including points-to analysis on OpenJDK7 (1.4M program variables, 350K objects, 160K methods) in under a minute. Souffl{\'e}¬†is being successfully used for Java security analyses at Oracle Labs due to (1) its high-performance, (2) support for rapid program analysis development, and (3) customizability. Souffl{\'e}¬†incorporates the highly flexible Datalog-based program analysis paradigm while exhibiting performance results that are on-par with manually developed state-of-the-art tools. In this tool paper, we introduce the Souffl{\'e}¬†architecture, usage and demonstrate its applicability for large-scale code analysis on the OpenJDK7 library as a use case.},

  abstract = {Ensuring correctness of smart contracts is paramount to ensuring trust in blockchain-based systems. This paper studies the safety and security of smart contracts in the Azure Blockchain Workbench, an enterprise Blockchain-as-a-Service offering from Microsoft. As part of this study, we formalize semantic conformance of smart contracts against a state machine model with access-control policy and develop a highly-automated formal verifier for Solidity that can produce proofs as well as counterexamples. We have applied our verifier VeriSol to analyze all contracts shipped with the Azure Blockchain Workbench, which includes application samples as well as a governance contract for Proof of Authority (PoA). We have found previously unknown bugs in these published smart contracts. After fixing these bugs, VeriSol was able to successfully perform full verification for all of these contracts.},

	abstract = {{In the last decade, smart contract security issues lead to tremendous
   losses, which has attracted increasing public attention both in industry
   and in academia. Researchers have embarked on efforts with logic rules,
   symbolic analysis, and formal analysis to achieve encouraging results in
   smart contract vulnerability detection tasks. However, the existing
   detection tools are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we attempt to
   utilize the deep learning-based approach, namely bidirectional
   long-short term memory with attention mechanism (BLSTM-ATT), aiming to
   precisely detect reentrancy bugs. Furthermore, we propose contract
   snippet representations for smart contracts, which contributes to
   capturing essential semantic information and control flow dependencies.
   Our extensive experimental studies on over 42,000 real-world smart
   contracts show that our proposed model and contract snippet
   representations significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods. In
   addition, this work proves that it is practical to apply deep
   learning-based technology on smart contract vulnerability detection,
   which is able to promote future research towards this area.}},

	abstract = {{Ethereum is the largest blockchain platform that supports smart
   contracts. Users deploy smart contracts by publishing the smart
   contract's bytecode to the blockchain. Since the data in the blockchain
   cannot be modified, even if these contracts contain bugs, it is not
   possible to patch deployed smart contracts with code updates. Moreover,
   there is currently neither a comprehensive classification framework for
   Ethereum smart contract bugs, nor detailed criteria for detecting bugs
   in smart contracts, making it difficult for developers to fully
   understand the negative effects of bugs and design new approaches to
   detect bugs. In this paper, to fill the gap, we first collect as many
   smart contract bugs as possible from multiple sources and divide these
   bugs into 9 categories by extending the IEEE Standard Classification for
   Software Anomalies. Then, we design the criteria for detecting each kind
   of bugs, and construct a dataset of smart contracts covering all kinds
   of bugs. With our framework and dataset, developers can learn smart
   contract bugs and develop new tools to detect and locate bugs in smart
   contracts. Moreover, we evaluate the state-of-the-art tools for smart
   contract analysis with our dataset and obtain some interesting findings:
   1) Mythril, Slither and Remix are the most worthwhile combination of
   analysis tools. 2) There are still 10 kinds of bugs that cannot be
   detected by any analysis tool.}},

@article{WOS:000525451000001,
	abstract = {{Smart contracts are programs that reside within decentralized
   blockchains and are executed pursuant to triggered instructions. A smart
   contract acts in a similar way to a traditional agreement but negates
   the necessity for the involvement of a third party. Smart contracts are
   capable of initiating their commands automatically, thus eliminating the
   involvement of a regulatory body. As a consequence of blockchain's
   immutable feature, smart contracts are developed in a manner that is
   distinct from traditional software. Once deployed to the blockchain, a
   smart contract cannot be modified or updated for security patches, thus
   encouraging developers to implement strong security strategies before
   deployment in order to avoid potential exploitation at a later time.
   However, the most recent dreadful attacks and the multifarious existing
   vulnerabilities which result as a consequence of the absence of security
   patches have challenged the sustainability of this technology. Attacks
   such as the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) attack and the
   Parity Wallet hack have cost millions of dollars simply as a consequence
   of naive bugs in the smart contract code. In this paper, we classify
   blockchain exploitation techniques into 4 categories based on the attack
   rationale; attacking consensus protocols, bugs in the smart contract,
   malware running in the operating system, and fraudulent users. We then
   focus on smart contract vulnerabilities, analyzing the 7 most important
   attack techniques to determine the real impact on smart contract
   technology. We reveal that even adopting the 10 most widely used tools
   to detect smart contract vulnerabilities, these still contain known
   vulnerabilities, providing a dangerously false sense of security. We
   conclude the paper with a discussion about recommendations and future
   research lines to progress towards a secure smart contract solution.}},

   Based on the runtime traces, ReGuard further dynamically identifies

	abstract = {{Ethereum has become a widely used platform to enable secure,
   Blockchain-based financial and business transactions. However, many
   identified bugs and vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to
   serious financial losses, which raises serious concerns about smart
   contract security. Thus, there is a significant need to better maintain
   smart contract code and ensure its high reliability.
   In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep learning
   based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts in
   Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and
   contract validation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more
   than 22K solidity contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain,
   results show that the clone ratio of solidity code is at around 90\%,
   much higher than traditional software. We collect a list of 52 known
   buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of common vulnerabilities as
   our bug database. Our approach can identify more than 1000 clone related
   bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately. (2)
   Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the
   approach in a web-based tool, named SmartEmbed, to facilitate Solidity
   developers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity
   developers to efficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the
   existing Ethereum blockchain, as well as checking their contract against
   a known set of bugs. which can help to improve the users' confidence in
   the reliability of the contract. We optimize the implementations of
   SmartEmbed which is sufficient in supporting developers in real-time for
   practical uses. The Ethereum ecosystem as well as the individual
   Solidity developer can both benefit from our research.}},

	abstract = {{Blockchain is deeply integrated into the vertical industry, and
   gradually forms an application ecosphere of blockchain in various
   industries. However, the security incidents of blockchain occur
   frequently, and especially smart contracts have become the
   badly-disastered area. So avoiding security incidents caused by smart
   contracts has become an essential topic for blockchain developing. Up to
   now, there is not generic method for the security auditing of smart
   contracts and most researchers have to use existing vulnerability
   detection technology. To reduce the high false rate of smart contract
   vulnerability detection, we use ReJection, a detection method based on
   abstract syntax tree (AST), to focus on the reentrancy vulnerability
   with obvious harm and features in smart contracts. ReJection consists of
   four steps. Firstly, ReJection obtains the AST corresponding to the
   contract by the smart contract compiler solc. Then, AST is preprocessed
   to eliminate redundant information. Thirdly, ReJection traverses the
   nodes of the AST and records the notations related to reentrancy
   vulnerabilities during the traversal, such as Danger-Transfer function,
   Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and mutex mechanism. Finally,
   ReJection uses record information and predefined rules to determine
   whether the reentrancy vulnerability is occurred. ReJection is
   implemented based on Slither, which is an open-source smart contract
   vulnerability detection tool. Furthermore, we also use the open-source
   smart contract code as the test program to compare experimental results
   to verify the effects with the ReJection and Slither. The result
   highlights that the ReJection has higher detection accuracy for
   reentrancy vulnerability.}},

	abstract = {{Ethereum is a major blockchain-based platform for smart contracts -
   Turing complete programs that are executed in a decentralized network
   and usually manipulate digital units of value. Solidity is the most
   mature high-level smart contract language. Ethereum is a hostile
   execution environment, where anonymous attackers exploit bugs for
   immediate financial gain. Developers have a very limited ability to
   patch deployed contracts. Hackers steal up to tens of millions of
   dollars from flawed contracts, a well-known example being ``The DAO{''},
   broken in June 2016. Advice on secure Ethereum programming practices is
   spread out across blogs, papers, and tutorials. Many sources are
   outdated due to a rapid pace of development in this field. Automated
   vulnerability detection tools, which help detect potentially problematic
   language constructs, are still underdeveloped in this area.
   We provide a comprehensive classification of code issues in Solidity and
   implement SmartCheck - an extensible static analysis tool that detects
   them(1). SmartCheck translates Solidity source code into an XML-based
   intermediate representation and checks it against XPath patterns. We
   evaluated our tool on a big dataset of real-world contracts and compared
   the results with manual audit on three contracts. Our tool reflects the
   current state of knowledge on Solidity vulnerabilities and shows
   significant improvements over alternatives. SmartCheck has its
   limitations, as detection of some bugs requires more sophisticated
   techniques such as taint analysis or even manual audit. We believe
   though that a static analyzer should be an essential part of contract
   developers' toolbox, letting them fix simple bugs fast and allocate more
   effort to complex issues.}},

	abstract = {{Smart contracts are executable programs that enable the building of a
   programmable trust mechanism between multiple entities without the need
   of a trusted third-party. At the time of this writing, there were over
   10 million smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum networks and this
   number continues to grow at a rapid pace. Smart contracts are often
   written in a Turing-complete programming language called Solidity, which
   is not easy to audit for subtle errors. Further, since smart contracts
   are immutable, errors have led to attacks resulting in losses of
   cryptocurrency worth 100s of millions of USD and reputational damage.
   Unfortunately, manual security analyses do not scale with size and
   number of smart contracts. Automated and scalable mechanisms are
   essential if smart contracts are to gain main-stream acceptance.
   Researchers have developed several security scanners in the past couple
   of years. However, many of these analyzer either do not scale well, or
   if they do, produce many false positives. This issue is exacerbated when
   bugs are triggered only after a series of interactions with the
   functions of the contractunder-test. A depth-n vulnerability, refers to
   a vulnerability that requires invoking a specific sequence of n
   functions to trigger. Depth-n vulnerabilities are time-consuming to
   detect by existing automated analyzers, because of the combinatorial
   explosion of sequences of functions that could be executed on smart
   contracts.
   In this paper, we present a technique to analyze depth-n vulnerabilities
   in an efficient and scalable way by combining symbolic execution and
   data dependency analysis. A significant advantage of combining symbolic
   with static analysis is that it scales much better than symbolic alone
   and does not have the problem of false positive that static analysis
   tools typically have. We have implemented our technique in a tool called
   MPro, a scalable and automated smart contract analyzer based on the
   existing symbolic analysis tool Mythril-Classic and the static analysis
   tool Slither. We analyzed 100 randomly chosen smart contracts on MPro
   and our evaluation shows that MPro is about n-times faster than
   Mythril-Classic for detecting depth-n vulnerabilities, while preserving
   all the detection capabilities of Mythril-Classic.}},

	abstract = {{The smart contracts deployed in Ethereum carry huge amounts of virtual
   coins. However, there are vulnerabilities in some of these smart
   contracts, which makes them vulnerable to malicious attacks. Due to the
   characteristics of blockchain, such vulnerable contracts are difficult
   to be revoked. In order to prevent vulnerable contracts, it is very
   important to detect the loopholes in these contracts before their
   deployment. In this paper, we focus on three vulnerabilities of smart
   contract:has\_short\_address,has\_flowsandis\_greedy. For the three
   kinds of vulnerabilities, we propose slicing matrix, a new method to
   extract vulnerability feature, and construct three vulnerability
   detection models for comparison. The experimental results show that the
   detection accuracy based on neural network and slice matrix is better
   than that based on neural network and opcode features. In other words,
   slice matrix can improve the accuracy of vulnerable contract detection.
   Among our three detection models, the model based on random forest and
   opcode features performs best.}},

   can exchange, buy, or sell cryptocurrencies. Smart contract, a computer
   program, can help Ethereum to encode rules or scripts for processing
   transactions. Because the smart contract usually handles large number of
   cryptocurrencies worth billions of dollars apiece, its security has
   gained considerable attention. In this paper, we first investigate the
   security of smart contracts running on the Ethereum and introduce
   several new security vulnerabilities that allow adversaries to exploit
   and gain financial benefits. Then, we propose a more practical smart
   contract analysis tool termed NeuCheck, in which we introduce the syntax
   tree in the syntactical analyzer to complete the transformation from
   source code to intermediate representation, and then adopt the open
   source library working with XML to analyze such tree. We have built a
   prototype of NeuCheck for Ethereum and evaluate it with over 52 000
   existing Ethereum smart contracts. The results show that (1) our new
   documented vulnerabilities are prevalent; (2) NeuCheck improves the
   analysis speed by at least 17.2 times compared to other popular analysis
   tools (eg, Securify and Mythril; and (3) allows for cross-platform

	abstract = {{The second generation of blockchain represented by smart contracts has
   been developing vigorously in recent years. However, frequent smart
   contract vulnerability incidents pose a serious risk to blockchain
   ecosystem security. Since current symbol execution tools often fall into
   path explosion and thus lead to inefficient detection, this paper
   expands Mythril's framework to optimize its performance. Firstly, it
   finds out potential vulnerable code regions using static analysis and
   identifies critical paths that may have security defects. Then, aiming
   at the problem that traditional search algorithms cannot actively locate
   and explore critical paths, this paper presents a multi-objective
   oriented path search (MOPS) strategy based on path priority. This
   strategy guides dynamic symbolic execution to cover critical paths
   quickly, avoiding blind traversal of program execution paths. Finally,
   it describes security rules and proposes corresponding detection logics
   for different vulnerability categories. This paper analyzes over 1000
   smart contracts extracted from Etherscan. Compared with existing tools
   based on symbolic execution, the proposed method can reduce time
   consumption by around 35\% while ensuring the accuracy of vulnerability
   detection. Moreover, existing tools often issue warnings that do not
   actually cause financial losses. But the proposed method only
   concentrates on code regions related to transfer of funds, so it can
   reduce the false alarm rate to some extent.}},

	abstract = {{A smart contract honeypot is a special type of smart contract. This type
   of contract seems to have obvious vulnerabilities in contract design. If
   a user transfers a certain amount of funds to the contract, then the
   user can withdraw the funds in the contract. However, once users try to
   take advantage of this seemingly obvious vulnerability, they will fall
   into a real trap. Consequently, the user's investment in the contract
   cannot be retrieved. The honeypot induces other accounts to launch
   funds, which seriously threatens the security of property on the
   blockchain. Detection methods for honeypots are available. However,
   studying the manner by which to defend existing honeypots is
   insufficient to fight against honeypots. The new honeypots that may
   appear in the future from the perspective of an attacker must also be
   predicted. Therefore, we propose a type of adversarial honeypot. The
   code and behavioral features of honeypots are obtained through a
   comparative analysis of the 158,568 non-honeypots and 352 honeypots. To
   build an adversarial honeypot, we try to separately hide these features
   and make the honeypot bypass the existing detection technology. We
   construct 18 instances on the basis of the proposed adversarial honeypot
   and use an open-source honeypot detection tool to detect these
   instances. The experimental result shows that the proposed honeypot can
   bypass the detection tool with a 100\% ratio. Therefore, this type of
   honeypot should be given attention, and defensive measures should be
   proposed as soon as possible.}},

	abstract = {{Recently, a number of existing blockchain systems have witnessed major
   bugs and vulnerabilities within smart contracts. Although the literature
   features a number of proposals for securing smart contracts, these
   proposals mostly focus on proving the correctness or absence of a
   certain type of vulnerability within a contract, but cannot protect
   deployed (legacy) contracts from being exploited. In this paper, we
   address this problem in the context of re-entrancy exploits and propose
   a novel smart contract security technology, dubbed Sereum (Secure
   Ethereum), which protects existing, deployed contracts against
   re-entrancy attacks in a backwards compatible way based on run-time
   monitoring and validation. Sereum does neither require any modification
   nor any semantic knowledge of existing contracts. By means of
   implementation and evaluation using the Ethereum blockchain, we show
   that Sereum covers the actual execution flow of a smart contract to
   accurately detect and prevent attacks with a false positive rate as
   small as 0.06\% and with negligible run-time overhead. As a by-product,
   we develop three advanced re-entrancy attacks to demonstrate the
   limitations of existing offline vulnerability analysis tools.}},

	abstract = {{The immutable feature of blockchain determines that traditional security
   response mechanisms (e.g., code patching) must change to remedy insecure
   smart contracts. The only proper way to protect a smart contract is to
   fix potential risks in its code before it is deployed to the blockchain.
   However, existing tools for smart contract security analysis focus on
   the detection of bugs but seldom consider the code fix issues.
   Meanwhile, it is often time-consuming and error-prone for a developer to
   understand and fix flawed code manually. In this paper we propose SMART
   SHIELD, a bytecode rectification system, to fix three typical
   security-related bugs (i.e., state changes after external calls, missing
   checks for out-of-bound arithmetic operations, and missing checks for
   failing external calls) in smart contracts automatically and help
   developers release secure contracts. Moreover, SMART SHIELD guarantees
   that the rectified contract is not only immune to certain attacks but
   also gas-friendly (i.e., a slightly increase of gas cost). To evaluate
   the effectiveness and efficiency of SMART SHIELD, we applied it to
   28,621 real-world buggy contracts on Ethereum blockchain (as of January
   2nd 2019). Experiment results demonstrated that among 95,502 insecure
   cases in those contracts, 87,346 (91.5\%) of them were automatically
   fixed by SMART SHIELD. A following test with both program analysis and
   real-world exploits further testified that the rectified contracts were
   secure against common attacks. Moreover, the rectification only
   introduced a 0.2\% gas increment for each contract on average.}},

	abstract = {{Currently, Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most popular cryptocurrency
   systems, especially Ethereum. It permits complex financial transactions
   or rules through scripts, which is called smart contracts. Since
   Ethereum smart contracts hold millions of dollars, their execution
   correctness is crucial against attacks which aim at stealing the assets.
   In this paper, we proposed a security assurance method for smart
   contract source code to find potential security risks. It contains two
   main functions, the first is syntax topological analysis of smart
   contract invocation relationship, to help developers to understand their
   code structure clearly; the second is logic risk (which may lead to
   vulnerabilities) detection and location, and label results on topology
   diagram. For developers' convenience, we have built a static analysis
   tool called SASC to generate topology diagram of invocation relationship
   and to find potential logic risks. We have made an evaluation on 2,952
   smart contracts, experiment results proved that our method is intuitive
   and effective.}},

   analysis tool to detect common integer overflow vulnerabilities of
   Solidity smart contracts in Ethereum through the defined XPath patterns.
   To evaluate our tool, we tested 7,000 verified Solidity smart contracts
   and found that there were 430 smart contracts with vulnerabilities of
   integer overflow. Experimental results show that there are still
   high-risk vulnerabilities of integer overflow in verified smart

@article{WOS:000687462200004,
	abstract = {{In recent years, a lot of vulnerabilities of smart contracts have been
   found. Hackers used these vulnerabilities to attack the corresponding
   contracts developed in the blockchain system such as Ethereum, and it
   has caused lots of economic losses. Therefore, it is very important to
   find out the potential problems of the smart contracts and develop more
   secure smart contracts. As blockchain security events have raised more
   important issues, more and more smart contract security analysis methods
   have been developed. Most of these methods are based on traditional
   static analysis or dynamic analysis methods. There are only a few
   methods that use emerging technologies, such as machine learning. Some
   models that use machine learning to detect smart contract
   vulnerabilities cost much time in extracting features manually. In this
   paper, we introduce a novel machine learning-based analysis model by
   introducing the shared child nodes for smart contract vulnerabilities.
   We build the Abstract-Syntax-Tree (AST) for smart contracts with some
   vulnerabilities from two data sets including SmartBugs and
   SolidiFI-benchmark. Then, we build the Abstract-Syntax-Tree (AST) of the
   labeled smart contract for data sets named Smartbugs-wilds. Next, we get
   the shared child nodes from both of the ASTs to obtain the structural
   similarity, and then, we construct a feature vector composed of the
   values that measure structural similarity automatically to build our
   machine learning model. Finally, we get a KNN model that can predict
   eight types of vulnerabilities including Re-entrancy, Arithmetic, Access
   Control, Denial of Service, Unchecked Low Level Calls, Bad Randomness,
   Front Running, and Denial of Service. The accuracy, recall, and
   precision of our KNN model are all higher than 90\%. In addition,
   compared with some other analysis tools including Oyente and SmartCheck,
   our model has higher accuracy. In addition, we spent less time for
   training .}},

	abstract = {{Smart contracts vulnerability auditing is vitally critical to ensure
   transaction execution in normal on blockchain. The current data-driven
   approaches normally tokenize smart contracts into a series of sequences
   according to only one tokenization standard for vulnerability detection
   purpose, resulting some of the semantic contexts could not be reflected
   within restricted sequence length.
   To address this limitation, we generate sequences from smart contracts
   in three tokenization standards for which we utilize ngram language
   model to capture semantic contexts respectively, and finally exploiting
   our effective combination strategy of Intersection or Union to integrate
   the audited results from multiple semantic contexts. In order to
   evaluate the proposed approach, we applied it on over 7200 Ethereum
   smart contract samples. Experimental result shows our proposed method is
   capable of detecting vulnerabilities and competitive with the baseline
   in test sets, with improved precision of over 44\% when Intersection is
   applied in their results, as well as improved Recall measure up by over
   300\% and F-measure up by 220\% when Union is applied. Our proposed
   method for smart contract vulnerability detection, an important tool for
   developing quality decentralized software applications, is able to
   analyze multiple semantic contexts and successfully detects more true

	abstract = {{A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate
   and enforce the negotiation of a contract in undependable environment.
   However, the number of attacks using the vulnerabilities of the smart
   contracts is also growing in recent years. Many solutions have been
   proposed in order to deal with them, such as documenting vulnerabilities
   or setting the security strategies. Among them, the most influential
   progress is made by the formal verification method. In this paper, we
   propose a formal verification method based on Colored Petri Nets (CPN)
   to verify smart contracts in blockchain system. First, we develop the
   smart contract models with possible attacker models based on
   hierarchical CPN modeling, then the smart contract models are executed
   by step-by-step simulation to validate their functional correctness, and
   finally we utilize the branch timing logic ASK-CTL based model checking
   technology in the CPN tools to detect latent vulnerabilities in smart
   contracts. We demonstrate that our CPN modeling based verification
   method can not only detect the logical vulnerabilities of the smart
   contract, but also consider the impacts of users behavior to find out
   potential non-logical vulnerabilities in the contracts, such as the
   vulnerabilities caused by the limitations of the Solidity language.}},

	abstract = {{Executing, verifying and enforcing credible transactions on
   permissionless blockchains is done using smart contracts. A key
   challenge with smart contracts is ensuring their correctness and
   security. To address this challenge, we present a fully automated
   technique, SolAnalyser, for vulnerability detection over Solidity smart
   contracts that uses both static and dynamic analysis. Analysis
   techniques in the literature rely on static analysis with a high rate of
   false positives or lack support for vulnerabilities like out of gas,
   unchecked send, timestamp dependency. Our tool, SolAnalyser, supports
   automated detection of 8 different vulnerability types that currently
   lack wide support in existing tools, and can easily be extended to
   support other types. We also implemented a fault seeding tool that
   injects different types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts. We use
   the mutated contracts for assessing the effectiveness of different
   analysis tools. Our experiment uses 1838 real contracts from which we
   generate 12866 mutated contracts by artificially seeding 8 different
   vulnerability types. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique in
   revealing the seeded vulnerabilities and compare against five existing
   popular analysis tools - Oyente, Securify, Maian, SmartCheck and
   Mythril. This is the first large scale evaluation of existing tools that
   compares their effectiveness by running them on a common set of
   contracts. We find that our technique outperforms all five existing
   tools in supporting detection of all 8 vulnerability types and in
   achieving higher precision and recall rate. SolAnalyser was also faster
   in analysing the different vulnerabilities than any of the existing
   tools in our experiment.}},

@article{WOS:000685204500074,
	abstract = {{The term ``smart contracts{''} has become ubiquitous to describe an
   enormous number of programs uploaded to the popular Ethereum blockchain
   system. Despite rapid growth of the smart contract ecosystem, errors and
   exploitations have been constantly reported from online contract
   systems, which has put financial stability at risk with losses totaling
   millions of US dollars. Most existing research focuses on pinpointing
   specific types of vulnerabilities using known patterns. However, due to
   the lack of awareness of the inherent nondeterminism in the Ethereum
   blockchain system and how it affects the funds transfer of smart
   contracts, there can be unknown vulnerabilities that may be exploited by
   attackers to access numerous online smart contracts.
   In this paper, we introduce a methodical approach to understanding the
   inherent nondeterminism in the Ethereum blockchain system and its
   (unwanted) influence on contract payments. We show that our new focus on
   nondeterminism-related smart contract payment bugs captures the root
   causes of many common vulnerabilities without relying on any known
   patterns and also encompasses recently disclosed issues that are not
   handled by existing research. To do so, we introduce techniques to
   systematically model components in the contract execution context and to
   expose various nondeterministic factors that are not yet fully
   understood. We further study how these nondeterministic factors impact
   contract funds transfer using information flow tracking. The technical
   challenge of detecting nondeterministic payments lies in discovering the
   contract global variables subtly affected by read-write hazards because
   of unpredictable transaction scheduling and external callee behavior. We
   show how to augment and instrument a contract program into a
   representation that simulates the execution of a large subset of the
   contract behavior. The instrumented code is then analyzed to flag
   nondeterministic global variables using off-the-shelf model checkers.
   We implement the proposed techniques as a practical tool named NPCHECKER
   (Nondeterministic Payment Checker) and evaluate it on 30K online
   contracts (3,075 distinct) collected from the Ethereum mainnet.
   NPCHECKER has successfully detected nondeterministic payments in 1,111
   online contracts with reasonable cost. Further investigation reports
   high precision of NPCHECKER (only four false positives in a manual study
   of 50 contracts). We also show that NPCHECKER unveils contracts
   vulnerable to recently-disclosed attack vectors. NPCHECKER can identify
   all six new vulnerabilities or variants of common smart contract
   vulnerabilities that are missed by existing research relying on a
   ``contract vulnerability checklist.{''}}},

	abstract = {{Smart contracts are automated or self-enforcing contracts that can be
   used to exchange assets without having to place trust in third parties.
   Many commercial transactions use smart contracts due to their potential
   benefits in terms of secure peer-to-peer transactions independent of
   external parties. Experience shows that many commonly used smart
   contracts are vulnerable to serious malicious attacks, which may enable
   attackers to steal valuable assets of involving parties. There is,
   therefore, a need to apply analysis and automated repair techniques to
   detect and repair bugs in smart contracts before being deployed. In this
   work, we present the first general-purpose automated smart contract
   repair approach that is also gas-aware. Our repair method is
   search-based and searches among mutations of the buggy contract. Our
   method also considers the gas usage of the candidate patches by
   leveraging our novel notion of gas dominance relationship. We have made
   our smart contract repair tool SCRepair available open-source, for
   investigation by the wider community.}},

	abstract = {{We investigate a family of bugs in blockchain-based smart contracts,
   which we dub event-ordering(or EO) bugs. These bugs are intimately
   related to the dynamic ordering of contract events, i.e. calls of its
   functions, and enable potential exploits of millions of USD worth of
   crypto-coins. Previous techniques to detect EO bugs have been restricted
   to those bugs that involve just one or two event orderings. Our work
   provides a new formulation of the general class of EO bugs arising in
   long permutations of such events by using techniques from concurrent
   program analysis.
   The technical challenge in detecting EO bugs in blockchain contracts is
   the inherent combinatorial blowup in path and state space analysis, even
   for simple contracts. We propose the first use of partial-order
   reduction techniques, using automatically extracted happens-before
   relations along with several dynamic symbolic execution optimizations.
   We build ETHRACER, an automatic analysis tool that runs directly on
   Ethereum bytecode and requires no hints from users. It flags 8\% of over
   10, 000 contracts analyzed, providing compact event traces (witnesses)
   that human analysts can examine in only a few minutes per contract. More
   than half of the flagged contracts are likely to have unintended
   behavior.}},

	abstract = {{In the new era of blockchain-based multi-agent robotic systems, smart
   contract programs perform an influential role in implementing
   decentralized applications with required task allocations. Smart
   contract programs are developed using script-type of programming
   languages, and they have already deployed several vulnerable patterns
   without proper testing and audit. We studied Solidity smart contracts
   running on the Ethereum platform and identified that they had been
   exploited because of several programming issues, especially using
   low-level external calls to malicious sources. Since smart contracts are
   immutable after their deployment to autonomous multi-robot systems, they
   should be tested to fix possible development phase issues. We
   implemented a prototype plugin called SolGuard by extending the solhint
   linter to prevent three critical issues related to Solidity smart
   contract programs' usage of external calls. The SolGuard plugin checks
   state variable order in the smart contracts, participation of
   delegatecall invocations, address type parameters in the smart
   contract's constructor, and denial of service patterns. We empirically
   evaluate the SolGuard plugin with existing popular static analysis
   tools. Our results indicate that SolGuard outperformed the baseline
   tools in terms of efficiency and accuracy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All

   Motivated by the known security breaches and recurring financial losses
   due to smart contracts vulnerabilities, we review the field of security
   of smart contract programming and provide a comprehensive taxonomy of
   all known security issues. We achieve that by a thorough review of known
   vulnerabilities. In this work we also review the security code analysis
   tools used to identify known vulnerabilities. We conduct the
   investigation of security code analysis tools on Ethereum by assessing
   their effectiveness and accuracy on known issues on a representative
   sample of vulnerable contracts. We have used 21 clean, and 24 vulnerable
   contracts and four security tools: Oyente, Securify, Remix, and
   SmartCheck, to assess the quality of contemporary security analysis
   tools specific to Ethereum. The results indicate that there are overall
   inconsistencies between the tools in respect to different security
   properties. SmartCheck outperformed the other tools in terms of
   effectiveness, whereas Oyente performed the best in terms of accuracy.
   Furthermore, based on the limitations we identified, we propose

	abstract = {{The recent growth of the blockchain technology market puts its main
   cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. Among them, Ethereum stands out due
   to its virtual machine (EVM) supporting smart contracts, i.e.,
   distributed programs that control the flow of the digital currency
   Ether. Being written in a Turing complete language, Ethereum smart
   contracts allow for expressing a broad spectrum of financial
   applications. The price for this expressiveness, however, is a
   significant semantic complexity, which increases the risk of programming
   errors. Recent attacks exploiting bugs in smart contract implementations
   call for the design of formal verification techniques for smart
   contracts. This, however, requires rigorous semantic foundations, a
   formal characterization of the expected security properties, and
   dedicated abstraction techniques tailored to the specific EVM semantics.
   This work will overview the state-of-the-art in smart contract
   verification, covering formal semantics, security definitions, and
   verification tools. We will then focus on EtherTrust {[}1], a framework
   for the static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts which includes the
   first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, the first formal
   characterization of a large class of security properties for smart

	abstract = {{Attacks on transactions of Ethereum could be dangerous because they
   could lead to a big loss of money. There are many tools detecting
   vulnerabilities in smart contracts trying to avoid potential attacks.
   However, we found that there are still many missed vulnerabilities in
   contracts. Motivated by this, we propose a methodology to reinforce EVM
   to stop dangerous transactions in real time even when the smart contract
   contains vulnerabilities. Basically, the methodology consists of three
   steps: monitoring strategy definition, opcode-structure maintenance and
   EVM instrumentation. Monitoring strategy definition refers to the
   specific rule to test whether there is a dangerous operation during
   transaction execution. Opcode-structure maintenance is to maintain a
   structure to store the rule related opcodes and analyze it before an
   operation execution. EVM instrumentation inserts the monitoring
   strategy, interrupting mechanism and the opcode-structure operations in
   EVM source code. For evaluation, we implement EVM{*} on js-evm, a
   widely-used EVM platform written in javascript. We collect 10 contracts
   online with known bugs and use each contract to execute a dangerous
   transaction, all of them have been interrupted by our reinforced EVM{*},
   while the original EVM permits all attack transactions. For the time
   overhead, the reinforced EVM{*} is slower than the original one by
   20-30\%, which is tolerable for the financial critical applications.}},

	abstract = {{The adoption of blockchain-based distributed computation platforms is
   growing fast. Some of these platforms, such as Ethereum, provide support
   for implementing smart contracts, which are envisioned to have novel
   applications in a broad range of areas, including finance and the
   Internet-of-Things. However, a significant number of smart contracts
   deployed in practice suffer from security vulnerabilities, which enable
   malicious users to steal assets from a contract or to cause damage.
   Vulnerabilities present a serious issue since contracts may handle
   financial assets of considerable value, and contract bugs are
   non-fixable by design. To help developers create more secure smart
   contracts, we introduce FSolidM, a framework rooted in rigorous
   semantics for designing contracts as Finite State Machines (FSM). We
   present a tool for creating FSM on an easy-to-use graphical interface
   and for automatically generating Ethereum contracts. Further, we
   introduce a set of design patterns, which we implement as plugins that
   developers can easily add to their contracts to enhance security and
   functionality.}},

	abstract = {{Background: Millions of smart contracts have been deployed to Ethereum
   for providing various applications. Recent studies discovered many
   severe security and performance issues in smart contracts by applying
   static program analysis techniques to them. Given a smart contract, the
   majority of these analysis techniques need to first construct its
   control flow graph, which connects basic blocks through control How
   transfers (CFTs), before conducting further analysis. Aims: The
   objective of this work is to understand the capabilities of static
   program analysis techniques to identify CFTs, and to investigate how
   static program analysis techniques can be improved if the CFTs are
   complemented. Method: We perform a comprehensive empirical study on six
   widely-used tools for smart contract analysis by using all deployed
   smart contracts to understand their capabilities to recognize CFTs. We
   capture all execution traces of all smart contracts to evaluate the
   number of CFTs covered by traces that are not found by those tools. We
   enhance a state-of-the-art tool. OYENTE for discovering vulnerabilities
   in smart contracts with the CFTs covered by traces to investigate how
   the tool is improved. Results: These studied tools fail to identify all
   CFTs due to several reasons, e.g., incomplete code patterns. Execution
   traces effectively complement these tool in recognizing CFTs. By
   including the CFCs covered by traces, the false negative rate of oYENTE
   can be reduced by up to 30\%. Conclusions: Our study underlines the
   ineffectiveness of static analysis techniques due to the incapabilities
   of CFT identification.}},

	abstract = {{Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure
   called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin
   and Ethereum, support the feature to encode rules or scripts for
   processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical
   shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are
   run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen
   steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding
   millions dollars worth of virtual coins.
   In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts
   based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of
   cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new security problems in which an
   adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain pro fit. These
   bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed
   semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways
   to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make contracts less
   vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum
   system, we build a symbolic execution tool called OYENTE to find
   potential security bugs. Among 19; 366 existing Ethereum contracts,
   OYENTE flags 8; 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug
   which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss
   the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source
   code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts)

	abstract = {{Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem
   for smart contracts: full-fledged intercommunicating programs that
   capture the transaction logic of an account. A gas limit caps the
   execution of an Ethereum smart contract: instructions, when executed,
   consume gas, and the execution proceeds as long as gas is available.
   Gas-focused vulnerabilities permit an attacker to force key contract
   functionality to run out of gas-effectively performing a permanent
   denial-of-service attack on the contract. Such vulnerabilities are among
   the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior
   may be uncommon in nonattack scenarios and reasoning about these
   vulnerabilities is nontrivial.
   In this paper, we identify gas-focused vulnerabilities and present
   MadMax: a static program analysis technique that automatically detects
   gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. MadMax combines a

	abstract = {{Smart contracts are decentralized applications running on Blockchain. A
   very large number of smart contracts has been deployed on Ethereum.
   Meanwhile, security flaws of contracts have led to huge pecuniary losses
   and destroyed the ecological stability of contract layer on Blockchain.
   It is thus an emerging yet crucial issue to effectively and efficiently
   detect vulnerabilities in contracts. Existing detection methods like
   Oyente and Securify are mainly based on symbolic execution or analysis.
   These methods are very time-consuming, as the symbolic execution
   requires the exploration of all executable paths or the analysis of
   dependency graphs in a contract. In this work, we propose ContractWard
   to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts with machine learning
   techniques. First, we extract bigram features from simplified operation
   codes of smart contracts. Second, we employ five machine learning
   algorithms and two sampling algorithms to build the models. ContractWard
   is evaluated with 49502 real-world smart contracts running on Ethereum.
   The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
   ContractWard. The predictive Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 of ContractWard are
   over 96\% and the average detection time is 4 seconds on each smart
   contract when we use XGBoost for training the models andSMOTETomek for
   balancing the training sets.}},

	abstract = {{Blockchain is a decentralized ledger technology, and it is the
   technology underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum. The interest in blockchain
   has been increasing since its emergence. Hyperledger Fabric is one of
   the permissioned blockchain frameworks. One of the characteristics of
   Hyperledger Fabric is it utilizes general-purpose programming languages,
   e.g., Go, Node.js, and Java, to implement smart contracts (called
   chaincode in Hyperledger Fabric). The advantages of utilizing these
   languages are already known to potential developers, and development
   tools might already exist. However, one of the disadvantages is that
   these languages were not originally designed for writing smart
   contracts. Hence, there may be risks that developers do not need to
   consider when using specific languages such as Solidity of Ethereum.
   Furthermore, even though development tools exist, how many risks are
   covered by the tools is an open question. In this paper, we focus on Go
   language and the tools. First, we surveyed what kind of risks are
   associated with chaincodes are developed using Go language and observed
   there are 14 potential risks. Then, we investigated how many risks can
   be covered by Go tools, e.g., golint and gosec, and a vulnerability
   detection tool for chaincodes called Chaincode Scanner. From our
   results, we observed that some risks are not covered by the existing
   tools. Hence, we develop a detection tool to cover risks by static
   analysis. Finally, in this paper, we describe how to find the risks with
   our tool and evaluate the usefulness.}},

	abstract = {{Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem
   for smart contracts: full-fledged intercommunicating programs that
   capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in
   mainstream languages, a gas limit restricts the execution of an Ethereum
   smart contract: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus,
   gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to
   provoke unwanted behavior in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or
   blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit
   undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other
   interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such vulnerabilities are among
   the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior
   may be uncommon in non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far
   from trivial.
   In this paper, we classify and identify gas-focused vulnerabilities, and
   present MadMax: a static program analysis technique to automatically
   detect gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. Our
   approach combines a control-flow-analysis-based decompiler and
   declarative program-structure queries. The combined analysis captures
   high-level domain-specific concepts (such as ``dynamic data structure
   storage{''} and ``safely resumable loops{''}) and achieves high
   precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart
   contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours (with
   decompilation timeouts in 8\% of the cases) and flags contracts with a
   (highly volatile) monetary value of over \$2.8B as vulnerable. Manual
   inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that 81\% of the
   sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities, which we report on
   in our experiment.}},

	abstract = {{Ethereum smart contracts are programs that are deployed and executed in
   a consensus-based blockchain managed by a peer-to-peer network. Several
   re-entrancy attacks that aim to steal Ether, the cryptocurrency used in
   Ethereum, stored in deployed smart contracts were found in the recent
   years. A countermeasure to such attacks is based on dynamic analysis
   that executes the smart contracts themselves, but it requires the
   spending of Ether and knowledge of attack patterns for analysis in
   advance. In this paper, we present a static analysis tool named RA
   (Re-entrancy Analyzer), a combination of symbolic execution and
   equivalence checking by a satisfiability modulo theories solver to
   analyze smart contract vulnerabilities against re-entrancy attacks. In
   contrast to existing tools, RA supports analysis of inter-contract
   behaviors by using only the Ethereum Virtual Machine bytecodes of target
   smart contracts, i.e., even without prior knowledge of attack patterns
   and without spending Ether. Furthermore, RA can verify existence of
   vulnerabilities against re-entrancy attacks without execution of smart
   contracts and it does not provide false positives and false negatives.
   We also present an implementation of RA to evaluate its performance in
   analyzing the vulnerability of deployed smart contracts against
   re-entrancy attacks and show that RA can precisely determine which smart
   contracts are vulnerable.}},

	abstract = {{Ethereum smart contracts are programs that can be collectively executed
   by a network of mutually untrusted nodes. Smart contracts handle and
   transfer assets of values, offering strong incentives for malicious
   attacks. Intrusion attacks are a popular type of malicious attacks. In
   this article, we propose ContractGuard, the first intrusion detection
   system (IDS) to defend Ethereum smart contracts against such attacks.
   Like IDSs for conventional programs, ContractGuard detects intrusion
   attempts as abnormal control flow. However, existing IDS
   techniques/tools are inapplicable to Ethereum smart contracts due to
   Ethereum's decentralized nature and its highly restrictive execution
   environment. To address these issues, we design ContractGuard by
   embedding it in the contracts to profile context-tagged acyclic paths,
   and optimizing it under the Ethereum gas-oriented performance model. The
   main goal is to minimize the overheads, to which the users will be
   extremely sensitive since the cost needs to be paid upfront in digital
   concurrency. Empirical investigation using real-life contracts deployed
   in the Ethereum mainnet shows that on average, ContractGuard only adds
   to 36.14 percent of the deployment overhead and 28.27 percent of the
   runtime overhead. Furthermore, we conducted controlled experiments and
   show that ContractGuard successfully guard against attacks on all
   real-world vulnerabilities and 83 percent of the seeded vulnerabilities.}},

   based on a successful combination of dynamic taint tracking (DTA) and
   concolic testing that allows users to analyze the bytecode of smart
   contracts being run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Moreover, Etherolic
   is not only able to identify a wide spectrum of recent vulnerabilities
   in smart contracts, but also it generates exploits to trigger unknown
   errors in the code. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of our
   approach, we evaluated Etherolic on a crafted benchmark suite,
   comprising several real-world and synthetic smart contracts along with
   98 safety features. The result of our preliminary evaluation reveals 204

	abstract = {{Smart contract vulnerabilities have attracted lots of concerns due to
   the resultant financial losses. Matching-based detection methods
   extrapolating known vulnerabilities to unknown have proven to be
   effective in other platforms. However, directly adopting the technique
   to smart contracts is obstructed by two issues, i.e., diversity of
   bytecode generation resulting from the rapid evolution of compilers and
   interference of noise code easily caused by the homogeneous business
   logics. To address the problems, we propose contract bytecode-oriented
   normalization and slicing techniques to augment bytecode matching.
   Specifically, we conduct data- and instruction-level normalizations to
   uniform the bytecode generated by different compilers, and enforce
   contract-specific slicing by tracking data- and control-flows with
   simulated bytecode executions to prune the noise code as far as
   possible. Based on the above techniques, we design an unsupervised graph
   embedding algorithm to encode the code graphs into quantitatively
   comparable vectors. The potentially vulnerable smart contracts can be
   identified by measuring the similarities between their vectors and known
   vulnerable ones. Our evaluations have shown the efficiency (0.47 seconds
   per contract on average), effectiveness (160 verified true positives)
   and high precision (91.95\% for top-ranked). It is worth noting that, we
   also identify dozens of honeypot contracts, further demonstrating the
   capability of our method.}},

	abstract = {{Motivated by the immutable nature of Ethereum smart contracts and of
   their transactions, quite many approaches have been proposed to detect
   defects and security problems before smart contracts become persistent
   in the blockchain and they are granted control on substantial financial
   value.
   Because smart contracts source code might not be available, static
   analysis approaches mostly face the challenge of analysing compiled
   Ethereum bytecode, that is available directly from the official
   blockchain. However, due to the intrinsic complexity of Ethereum
   bytecode (especially in jump resolution), static analysis encounters
   significant obstacles that reduce the accuracy of exiting automated
   tools.
   This paper presents a novel static analysis algorithm based on the
   symbolic execution of the Ethereum operand stack that allows us to
   resolve jumps in Ethereum bytecode and to construct an accurate
   control-flow graph (CFG) of the compiled smart contracts. EtherSolve is
   a prototype implementation of our approach. Experimental results on a
   significant set of real world Ethereum smart contracts show that
   EtherSolve improves the accuracy of the execrated CFGs with respect to
   the state of the art available approaches.
   Many static analysis techniques are based on the CFG representation of
   the code and would therefore benefit from the accurate extraction of the
   CFG. For example, we implemented a simple extension of EtherSolve that
   allows to detect instances of the re-entrancy vulnerability.}},

   applications, they are extremely vulnerable to different forms of

   on the overflow attacks in Ethereum, mainly because they widely rooted

   Specifically, EASYFLOW can not only divide smart contracts into safe
   contracts, manifested overflows, well-protected overflows and potential
   overflows, but also automatically generate transactions to trigger
   potential overflows. In our preliminary evaluation, EASYFLOW managed to
   find potentially vulnerable Ethereum contracts with little runtime

	abstract = {{Smart contracts have become lucrative and profitable targets for
   attackers because they can hold a great amount of money. Unfortunately,
   existing offline approaches for discovering the vulnerabilities in smart
   contracts or checking the correctness of smart contracts cannot conduct
   online detection of attacking transactions. Besides, existing online
   approaches only focus on specific attacks and cannot be easily extended
   to detect other attacks. Moreover, developing a new online detection
   system for smart contracts from scratch is time-consuming and requires
   deep understanding of blockchain internals, thus making it difficult to
   quickly implement and deploy mechanisms to detect new attacks. In this
   paper, we propose a novel generic online detection framework named SODA
   for smart contracts on any blockchains that support Ethereum virtual
   machine (EVM). SODA distinguishes itself from existing online approaches
   through its capability, efficiency, and compatibility. First, SODA
   empowers users to easily develop apps for detecting various attacks
   online (i.e., when attacks happen) by separating information collection
   and attack detection with layered design. At the higher layer, SODA
   provides unified interfaces to develop detection apps against various
   attacks. At the lower layer, SODA instruments EVM to collect all
   primitive information necessary to detect various attacks and constructs
   11 kinds of structural information for the ease of developing apps.
   Based on SODA, users can develop new apps in a few lines of code without
   modifying EVM. Second, SODA is efficient, because we design on-demand
   information retrieval to reduce the overhead of information collection
   and adopt dynamic linking to eliminate the overhead of inter-process
   communication. Such design allows users to develop detection apps using
   any programming languages that can generate dynamic link libraries.
   Third, since more and more blockchains adopt EVM as smart contract
   runtime, SODA can be easily migrated to such blockchains without
   modifying apps. Based on SODA, we develop 8 detection apps to detect the
   attacks exploiting major vulnerabilities in smart contracts, and
   integrate SODA (including all apps) into 3 popular blockchains:
   Ethereum, Expanse and Wanchain. The extensive experimental results
   demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SODA and our detection
   apps.}},

	abstract = {{Blockchain as a distributed computing platform enables users to deploy
   pieces of software (known as smart contracts) for a wealth of
   next-generation decentralized applications without involving a trusted
   third-party. The advantages of smart contracts do, however, come at a
   price. As with most technologies, there are potential security threats,
   vulnerabilities and various other issues associated with smart
   contracts. Writing secure and safe smart contracts can be extremely
   difficult due to various business logics, as well as platform
   vulnerabilities and limitations. Formal methods have recently been
   advocated to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This paper aims to provide
   a first-time study on current formalization research on all smart
   contract-related platforms on blockchains, which is scarce in the
   literature. To this end, a timely and rigorous systematic review to
   examine the state-of-the-art research and achievements published between
   2015 and July 2019 is provided. This study is based on a comprehensive
   review of a set of 35 research papers that have been extracted from
   eight major online digital databases. The results indicate that the most
   common formalization technique is theorem proving, which is most often
   used to verify security properties relating to smart contracts, while
   other techniques such as symbolic execution and model checking were also
   frequently used. These techniques were most commonly used to verify the
   functional correctness of smart contracts. From the language and
   automation point of views, there were 12 languages (domain
   specific/specification/general purpose) proposed or used for the
   formalization of smart contracts on blockchains, while 15 formal
   method-specific automated tools/frameworks were identified for
   mitigating various vulnerabilities of smart contracts. From the results
   of this work, we further highlight three open issues for future research
   in this emerging domain including: formal testing, automated
   verification of smart contracts, and domain specific languages (DSLs)
   for Ethereum. These issues suggest the need for additional, in-depth
   research. Our study also provides possible future research directions.

	abstract = {{Reasoning about commutativity between data-structure operations is an
   important problem with applications including parallelizing compilers,
   optimistic parallelization and, more recently, Ethereum smart contracts.
   There have been research results on automatic generation of
   commutativity conditions, yet we are unaware of any fully automated
   technique to generate conditions that are both sound and effective.
   We have designed such a technique, driven by an algorithm that
   iteratively refines a conservative approximation of the commutativity
   (and non-commutativity) condition for a pair of methods into an
   increasingly precise version. The algorithm terminates if/when the
   entire state space has been considered, and can be aborted at any time
   to obtain a partial yet sound commutativity condition. We have
   generalized our work to left-/right-movers {[}27] and proved relative
   completeness. We describe aspects of our technique that lead to useful
   commutativity conditions, including how predicates are selected during
   refinement and heuristics that impact the output shape of the condition.
   We have implemented our technique in a prototype open-source tool
   SERVOIS. Our algorithm produces quantifier-free queries that are
   dispatched to a back-end SMT solver. We evaluate SERVOIS through two
   case studies: (i) We synthesize commutativity conditions for a range of
   data structures including Set, HashTable, Accumulator, Counter, and
   Stack. (ii) We consider an Ethereum smart contract called BlockKing, and
   show that SERVOIS can detect serious concurrency-related vulnerabilities
   and guide developers to construct robust and efficient implementations.}},

	abstract = {{The popularity of blockchain technology encourages organizations to use
   more blockchain features in mission critical processes such as trading,
   access control and computational public safety. Automation of processes
   with smart contracts is one of these features that significantly enlarge
   the scope of a blockchain implementation. Smart contracts help automate
   business processes by modeling business activities on the distributed
   ledger. Smart contracts are significantly different from other programs
   from a defect fixing and security issue handling perspective. The
   opportunity of fixing such issues is only available in the narrow window
   before registering the contract on to the blockchain. After a smart
   contract becomes a part of the chain, it is not possible to update or
   fix any issues. This distinct nature of smart contracts makes it
   essential to detect the program issues early on by paying attention to
   security smells. Security smells are clues that point to a deeper
   problem in the programming space.
   In this study, we review the literature and identify vulnerabilities
   that programmers and beneficiaries of smart contracts must avoid. We
   explain these security smells and categorize them based on their nature.
   We also review the applications that detect these vulnerabilities and
   provide information about their approach and coverage. Our main
   contribution is the evaluation of smart contracts as a platform or aid
   for mission critical applications such as access control platforms. We
   conducted this evaluation by identifying the issues related to smart
   contracts and informing the reader about the problem, challenges, and

@article{WOS:000685203900086,
	abstract = {{Callbacks are an effective programming discipline for implementing
   event-driven programming, especially in environments like Ethereum which
   forbid shared global state and concurrency. Callbacks allow a callee to
   delegate the execution back to the caller. Though effective, they can
   lead to subtle mistakes principally in open environments where callbacks
   can be added in a new code. Indeed, several high profile bugs in smart
   contracts exploit callbacks. We present the first static technique
   ensuring modularity in the presence of callbacks and apply it to verify
   prominent smart contracts. Modularity ensures that external calls to
   other contracts cannot affect the behavior of the contract. Importantly,
   modularity is guaranteed without restricting programming.
   In general, checking modularity is undecidable -even for programs
   without loops. This paper describes an effective technique for soundly
   ensuring modularity harnessing SMT solvers. The main idea is to define a
   constructive version of modularity using commutativity and projection
   operations on program segments. We believe that this approach is also
   accessible to programmers, since counterexamples to modularity can be
   generated automatically by the SMT solvers, allowing programmers to
   understand and fix the error.
   We implemented our approach in order to demonstrate the precision of the
   modularity analysis and applied it to real smart contracts, including a
   subset of the 150 most active contracts in Ethereum. Our implementation
   decompiles bytecode programs into an intermediate representation and
   then implements the modularity checking using SMT queries. Overall, we
   argue that our experimental results indicate that the method can be
   applied to many realistic contracts, and that it is able to prove
   modularity where other methods fail.}},

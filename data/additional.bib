  abstract  = {Analyzing Ethereum bytecode, rather than the source code from which it was generated, is a necessity when: (1) the source code is not available (e.g., the blockchain only stores the bytecode), (2) the information to be gathered in the analysis is only visible at the level of bytecode (e.g., gas consumption is specified at the level of EVM instructions), (3) the analysis results may be affected by optimizations performed by the compiler (thus the analysis should be done ideally after compilation). This paper presents EthIR, a framework for analyzing Ethereum bytecode, which relies on (an extension of) Oyente, a tool that generates CFGs; EthIR produces from the CFGs, a rule-based representation (RBR) of the bytecode that enables the application of (existing) high-level analyses to infer properties of EVM code.},

  abstract  = {Ethereum smart contracts---autonomous programs that run on a blockchain---often control transactions of financial and intellectual property. Because of the critical role they play, smart contracts need complete, comprehensive, and effective test generation. This paper introduces an open-source smart contract fuzzer called Echidna that makes it easy to automatically generate tests to detect violations in assertions and custom properties. Echidna is easy to install and does not require a complex configuration or deployment of contracts to a local blockchain. It offers responsive feedback, captures many property violations, and its default settings are calibrated based on experimental data. To date, Echidna has been used in more than 10 large paid security audits, and feedback from those audits has driven the features and user experience of Echidna, both in terms of practical usability (e.g., smart contract frameworks like Truffle and Embark) and test generation strategies. Echidna aims to be good at finding real bugs in smart contracts, with minimal user effort and maximal speed.},

  abstract  = {Fuzzing and symbolic execution are two complementary techniques for discovering software vulnerabilities. Fuzzing is fast and scalable, but can be ineffective when it fails to randomly select the right inputs. Symbolic execution is thorough but slow and often does not scale to deep program paths with complex path conditions. In this work, we propose to learn an effective and fast fuzzer from symbolic execution, by phrasing the learning task in the framework of imitation learning. During learning, a symbolic execution expert generates a large number of quality inputs improving coverage on thousands of programs. Then, a fuzzing policy, represented with a suitable architecture of neural networks, is trained on the generated dataset. The learned policy can then be used to fuzz new programs. We instantiate our approach to the problem of fuzzing smart contracts, a domain where contracts often implement similar functionality (facilitating learning) and security is of utmost importance. We present an end-to-end system, ILF (for Imitation Learning based Fuzzer), and an extensive evaluation over &gt;18K contracts. Our results show that ILF is effective: (i) it is fast, generating 148 transactions per second, (ii) it outperforms existing fuzzers (e.g., achieving 33% more coverage), and (iii) it detects more vulnerabilities than existing fuzzing and symbolic execution tools for Ethereum.},

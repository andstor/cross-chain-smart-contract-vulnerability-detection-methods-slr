\chapter{Discussion}


In this \acrlong{slr}, efforts are made to systemize the state-of-the-art research on various blockchain platforms. A total of ? \todo{Fill in \# pages} papers (or online resources) available as of 2021 has been discussed and analyzed.

\section{Comparison with related work}
comparison with related work
Argue that your study brings something new and useful.

Compared to related surveys on the topic of smart contract vulnerability analysis and detection \cite{liu2019asurvey, huang2019smart, almakhour2020verification, he2020smart, vacca2021asystematic, kim2020analysis, peng2021security, wang2021security} (see \namecref{chap:related-work}), this study covers a wider range of blockchain platforms. Where most surveys focus on the Ethereum blockchain, this study focuses on other blockchain platforms.

From the findings presented in \namecref{chap:results}, we can clearly see that the research of vulnerability analysis of other blockchain platforms than Ethereum is lacking. Even with deliberate efforts for covering other blockchain platforms, almost all research focuses exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain, with some minor exceptions being Hyperledger Fabric. The area of blockchain is immature. It is therefore expected that the popularity of Ethereum steals most of the research resources. 



\section{Threats to Validity}
Selection process is subject to subjective criteria. Only one author.

Only use one database. Missing results... However, itdoes contain a lott of research from other database
lack of snowballing (forward and backward)  https://www.wohlin.eu/esem12a.pdf ==> more relevant publications to complement and to bring a more qualified analysis.

From the findings presented in \namecref{chap:results}, we can clearly see that the research of vulnerability analysis of other blockchain platforms are lacking. The area of blockchain is immature. It is therefore normal that the popularity of Ethereum steals most of the research resources. However, with the increasing popularity of other platforms, so does the need for security research on these chains. The few analyses that has been conducted on other \acrshort{sc}-supporting chains than Ethereum has mainly been restricted to the analysis of the security of the chain itself.

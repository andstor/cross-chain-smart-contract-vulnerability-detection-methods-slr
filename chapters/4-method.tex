\section{Research Motivation}

Most prior works related to the detection and mitigation of software vulnerabilities have been focused on the software development life cycle. The software development process is a complex and iterative process. However, \acrshort{sc} requires a very different approach. Due to the immutable properties of \acrshort{sc}, all bugs and vulnerabilities needs to be removed before the code is put in production.

The area of cross-chain vulnerability analysis and detection has received limited attention. There are no papers primarily focused on cross-chain vulnerability analysis and detection. The research community is still in the early stages of the development of such a research topic. The need for a clear and systematic literature review of the current \acrshort{sc} vulnerability detection tools and methods that may be applicable for cross-chain is prominent. Through this \acrfull{slr}, an attempt to address this will be made by answering the research questions defined in \cref{sec:research-questions}.

\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research-questions}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{RQ\arabic*.}, leftmargin=1.5cm]
    \item What are the current approaches for \acrlong{sc} vulnerability detection?\\
    \item What is the current research on cross-chain \acrlong{sc} vulnerability detection?\\
    \item How to make \acrlong{sc} vulnerability detecting possible cross-chain?\\
\end{enumerate}

\section{Research Method and Design}
The research method and design principles adopted in this \acrshort{slr} are based on the following principles by ....:\\
sitat
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Identify the need for the review, prepare a proposal for the review, and develop the review protocol.
    \item Identify the research, select the studies, assess the quality, take notes and extract data, synthesise the data.
    \item Report the results of the review.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Locating Studies}
In the first step, we need to locate the studies that are related to \acrlong{sc} vulnerability detection. \acrfull{wos} was used as the main scientific database. The following search string for \acrshort{wos} was defined for this literature review:
\begin{quote}
    TS=("smart contract" AND (vulnerability OR bug) AND (detection OR analysis OR tool))
\end{quote}
No time restrictions was set. The search results were exported to a \gls{bibtex} file and processed locally.

\subsection{Study Selection and evaluation}
In order to assess the retrieved literature for it's eligibility, the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in \cref{tab:inclusion-exclusion-criteria} were used.

\subsection{Analysis and Synthesis}

The search resulted in 84 publications from \gls{wos}. The literature was then reduced in a series of steps. This process is visualized in \cref{fig:flowchart-search-selection-strategy}. In the identification stage, the literature was screened for any non-english articles, missing abstracts, notes or editorials. During screening, ? articles were removed based on the title, and ? were removed based on the abstract. After full-text screening at the eligibility stage, ? articles were cut. The resulting literature was reduced to a total of ??? publications.

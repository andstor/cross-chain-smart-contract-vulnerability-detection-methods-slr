The area of \acrshort{sc} vulnerability analysis and detection has already come a long way, even though the area of blockchain is still in its infancy. There are still many research gaps needing to be filled. From this \acrshort{slr}, one can see there is a noticeable lack in research on vulnerability detection for other blockchain platforms than Ethereum. Further, there is a need for more research on the analysis of what vulnerabilities apply to the various blockchain platforms.

As discussed earlier in \cref{sec:results-rq2}, several solutions for Ethereum may be applicable for cross-chain detection. In the area of \gls{deep-learning}, there is significant potential in creating deep learning models that can function across different platforms. There is a need for assessing the cross-chain applicability of currently available tools. However, a significant limitation for these solutions is the lack of training data for other blockchain platforms, as Ethereum is currently the only platform with sufficient deployed \acrfullpl{sc}. A sound way to produce adequate training data for other blockchain platforms would therefore be required in order to allow for deep learning models to function for multiple platforms. This would make it more desirable for other people to start using other blockchain platforms, and in turn, encourage researchers to expand their research area to other blockchain platforms.

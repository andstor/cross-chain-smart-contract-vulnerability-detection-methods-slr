This chapter provides a short overview of state-of-the-art secondary studies related to \acrfull{sc} vulnerability analysis and detection. This is various literature that presents a survey or literature review nature.

One of the earliest studies on smart contract vulnerability analysis and detection were conducted in \citeyear{atzei2017survey} by \textcite{atzei2017survey}. The authors provided a survey on Ethereum smart contract attacks. They analyzed the security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts and provides a taxonomy of common programming pitfalls. Later in \citeyear{grishchenko2018foundations}, \textcite{grishchenko2018foundations} published an overview of smart contract verification, covering formal semantics, security definitions, and verification tools. In the following years several surveys and reviews were conducted. Most recently in \citeyear{peng2021security}, \textcite{peng2021security} published a review of known security challenges and solutions to the security issues of smart contracts in an \acrshort{iot} setting. \cref{tab:related-work} presents a list of some secondary studies related to smart contract vulnerability analysis and detection. All of these studies provide some insights into the current research on smart contract vulnerability analysis and detection. However, most  of the research focuses exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain.

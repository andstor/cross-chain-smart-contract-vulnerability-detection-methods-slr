\textcite{matsumura2021vulnerabilities} conducts a systematic literature mapping. They identify several tools for analyzing \acrshort{sc} and how to deal with the identified vulnerabilities. However, solutions for the detected vulnerabilities are primarily for avoiding the security issues, and not for correcting them.

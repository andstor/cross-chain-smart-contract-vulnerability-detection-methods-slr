The term Blockchain was popularized by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 with his publication of the article "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". A blockchain is a shared, immutable, digital ledger of transactions. Along with the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, this marks the birth of cryptocurrencies. In 2014, Ethereum extended the blockchain technology to include so-called \acrfullpl{sc}. A \acrshort{sc} is a program stored on a blockchain that runs when some predetermined conditions are met. This technology has paved the way for numerous new applications across a multitude of disciplines, including both finance, health, ......, 

Blockchain has revolutionized the way in which we are able to share data in a secure, transparent, and traceable manner. This also applies to \acrshortpl{sc}. Once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be changed. Due to most blockchains' monetary and anonymous nature, they pose as a desirable target for adversaries and manipulators \cite{atzei2017survey}. Smart contracts often handle and store hundreds of millions of dollars worth of digital assets. This leads to deep concerns as to how to protect the assets from theft, fraud, and other forms of corruption. One of the most infamous blockchain attacks was the crowdfunding project \acrfull{dao} hack. This hack exploited a simple vulnerability in the contract language of Ethereum, resulting in an economic loss worth about 60 million dollars at the time\cite{atzei2017asurvey}. It is therefore imperative that all bugs and errors are pruned out before deployment, a difficult task.

There has been quite a lot of research devoted to vulnerability detection on the most popular blockchain platforms, mainly Ethereum, along with its smart contract language Solidity \cite{peng2021security, sing2020blockchain}. However, not much focus has been devoted to other, less popular blockchains \cite{chen2020asurvey, kim2020analysis}. As stated by \textcite{chen2020asurvey}, \enquote{The blockchain community keeps evolving very fast, and the most popular platform and language at one time can soon turn outdated.}. With the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, so does the need for security research.

In order to better secure the vast \acrfull{sc} ecosystem, one would need to find a way to detect and prevent these vulnerabilities across multiple blockchains (or cross-chain). The area has attracted much academic interest. Still, a vast amount of the research on security methods of \acrshortpl{sc} is scattered across scientific papers, online resources, and forums. There is a need to structure and systemize the research to continue evolving the field. In particular, the methods which are transferrable to other blockchains are of particular importance.

The purpose of this document is to investigate the current state-of-the-art in vulnerability detection, in particular cross-chain vulnerability detection. Challenges and opportunities of cross-chain vulnerability detection methods will be discussed, along with purposed future work. Compared to other studies, this review will have a broader scope than just Ethereum, by including other blockchain platforms. Also, a focus will be on which vulnerabilities the tools can detect. \todo{remove the last line?}

\label{chap:conclusion}

This paper presents the results of a \acrlong{slr} of existing \acrlong{sc} vulnerability analysis and detection methods. The motivation for this study was to provide an state-of-the-art overview of the current situation of the \acrshort{sc} vulnerability detection. A total of ? papers were selected, based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A systematic analysis and synthesis of the data were extracted from the papers and comprehensive reviews were performed. Further, to the greatest extent, this paper also identifies the current available cross-chain tools and methods. The cross-chain applicability for these assets are investigated and analyzed.

The findings from this study shows that there are a number of methods and implemented tools readily available for vulnerability analysis and detection. Several of these tools shows great results. The most prevalent methods are static analysis tools, where symbolic execution is by far the most popular. Other methods such as syntax analysis, abstract interpretation, data flow analysis, fuzzy testing, and deep learning are also readily used. In this paper, some potential cross-platform tools are highlighted and discussed. Although they pose several limitations, they show significant potential for further development. Especially interesting is the potential \acrlong{ml}-based cross-chain detection methods.

From this study, one can see that there is a significant lack of research on vulnerability detection on other blockchain platforms than Ethereum. The hope is that the results from this study provide a starting point for future research on cross-chain analysis.

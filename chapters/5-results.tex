\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:results}

The results chapter should simply present the results of applying the methods presented in the method chapter without further ado. This chapter will typically contain many graphs, tables, etc. Sometimes it is natural to discuss the results as they are presented, combining them into a ‘Results and Discussion’ chapter, but more often they are kept separate.

There are many existing methods and tools for vulnerability detection. These can be divided up into three categories: Static Vulnerability Detection, Dynamic Vulnerability Detection, and Machine Learning based Vulnerability Detection. The following table lists the tools and their respective categories.

\section{Machine Learning for Vulnerability Detection}
"Several works have attempted to perform automated contract scan- ning using machine learning techniques. We discuss their working mechanisms and limitations below."

\subsection{ContractWard}
ContractWard \cite{wang2021contractward} implements a smart contract vulnerability detection tool based on machine learning. It is a state-of-the-art tool for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. It is a multi-label classifier that can detect multiple vulnerabilities. The method is based on a bigram model. The input is the bytecode of the smart contract. The output is a binary decision. The decision is 1 if the contract is vulnerable, 0 otherwise.

Models for Ethereum Smart Contracts Uses XGBoost as multi label classifier with SMOTETomke as sampling method. ses simplified smar contract opcodes as input. the static opcodes represent static featturesof contracts. the tool is appropriate for rapid batch detection of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, with an average detection speed of 4 seconds per contract. Reliable with Micro-F1 and Macro-F1 over 96\%. Only operates on opcodes as input.
simplified smart contract opcodes are extracted from the bytecode of smart contracts.

\subsection{ESCORT}
ESCORT provides a long short-term memory machine learning model in order to detect smart contract vulnerabilities. ContractScraper is used to extract the bytecode of the smart contract. The model is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The model is trained on the Ethereum blockchain. The model is able to detect multiple vulnerabilities. The model is capable of detecting the following vulnerabilities:

"ESCORT, the first Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based vulnerability detection framework for Ethereum smart contracts that supports lightweight transfer learning on unseen security vulnerabilities, thus is exten- sible and generalizable"













\section{Research Question 1: What are the current approaches for \acrlong{sc} vulnerability detection?}
\todo{Majority of the tables, and existing vulnerability tools needs to be describeed here.}






\section{Research Question 2: What is the current research on cross-chain \acrlong{sc} vulnerability detection?}

"Cross-chain vulnerability detection is a method for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contract code across multiple blockchains. Little efforts have been made to develop a cross-chain vulnerability detection framework. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of cross-chain vulnerability detection."


\textcite{kalra2018zeus} provides a tool called Zeus. Zeus translates the \Gls{solidity} \acrshort{sc} language into LLVM-IR language. \gls{llvm} is a compiler toolchain, that supports a large ecosystem of code analysis tools. However, the \gls{llvmir} is very  is an \acrshort{ir} that  that can be used to detect vulnerabilities in the \acrshortpl{sc} language.

\textcite{lewispye2021general} conducts a systematic literature mapping identifying A General Framework for the Security Analysis of Blockchain Protocols

Not much actual research. However there are some interesting solutions that might be applicable for cross-chain detection.




\section{Research Question 4: How to make \acrlong{sc} vulnerability detecting possible cross-chain?}


\textcite{matsumura2021vulnerabilities} suggest \acrshortpl{ml} for automatic vulnerability detection as future work. This because it is a promising vulnerability detection technique for traditional software, it doesn’t rely heavy on human-defined rules and has obtained competitive results.

for \acrshortpl{sc} vulnerability detection. This because \acrshortpl{ml} has been shown to be a promising vulnerability detection technique 

since it is a promising vulnerability detection technique even for traditional software [7,15], does not rely heavily on rules defined by human experts and has obtained competitive results; research proposing solutions involving dynamic analysis or software testing, seeking to deal with the limitations of the execution environment.
